How to :
- Run Make first
- Launch ./server, a PID appears on screen
- Launch ./client with the PID as first argument and followed by whatever shit you want towrite.
- YOLO

Update 02/09/14 : files modified. Addition of sigaction system but usleep(30) remains though. The server now displays the full string directly instead of one char at a time.
